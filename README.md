The project aims at reducing the queue waiting-time of customers in large supermarkets such as Tesco.
Upon examining and talking to customers from various supermarket outlets, it is evident that long
queues lead to customer dissatisfaction. Shoppers tend to overestimate the waiting time leading to a
negative perception of the overall queuing time. QwikScan that supports self-scanning and checkout,
reduces queuing time leading to higher customer satisfaction. Tesco customers can scan the products as
they buy, on their own phone using the app and make an online payment, thus eliminating their need to
wait in the long queues. Customers also have the alternative option of generating a single QR code of
total products and pay at the counter. Tesco already has self-checkout kiosks but they are limited to few
numbers and, also stationery. Our app makes every userâ€™s phone a kiosk and decreases queue time by a
big margin.
